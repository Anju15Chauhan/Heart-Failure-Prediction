# **Heart Failure Prediction**

## **Overview**

This dataset contains medical records of patients, aimed at predicting heart disease based on various health metrics. It includes 12 features and 918 records, providing data on factors such as age, sex, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and more.

## **Dataset Information**

1. **Number of Instances:** 918

2. **Number of Features:** 12
   
# Features:

**1. Age:** Age of the patient (in years)

**2. Sex:** Gender of the patient (M for male, F for female)

**3. ChestPainType:** Type of chest pain experienced (ATA, NAP, ASY, TA)

**4. RestingBP:** Resting blood pressure (in mm Hg)

**5. Cholesterol:** Serum cholesterol (in mg/dl)

**6. FastingBS:** Fasting blood sugar (1 if > 120 mg/dl, 0 otherwise)

**7. RestingECG:** Resting electrocardiogram results (Normal, ST, LVH)

**9. ExerciseAngina:** Exercise-induced angina (Y for yes, N for no)

**10. Oldpeak:** ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest

**11. ST_Slope:** The slope of the peak exercise ST segment (Up, Flat, Down)

**12. HeartDisease:** The target variable (1 for presence of heart disease, 0 for absence)

# Usage

This dataset is ideal for training machine learning models to predict the likelihood of heart disease based on patient health metrics. It's suitable for classification tasks and can be used to explore the relationship between various factors and heart disease.
